# Image Classifier Website using Flask and SGD Model

This project is a web application for image classification built with Flask and utilizes an SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) model. It allows users to upload animal images and receive predictions regarding the animal name.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Running the Application

1. Once the dependencies are installed, run the Flask application using `python3 flask_app.py`.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the link provided to access the application

## Usage

- Upon accessing the website, users can upload an image using the provided interface.
- Click on the "Upload" button and select an image from your local system.
- After the upload is complete, the image will be displayed on the webpage along with the predicted classification generated by the SGD model.

- ## Model Details

The image classification model utilized in this project is based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It has been trained on a dataset consisting of various labled images of different animals to classify images into specific categories.
